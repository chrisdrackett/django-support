About
=====

This app is a collection of "stuff" that I end up using on every django project. I'll be moving things into here as I run into them.

Installation
============

The easy way to install is to use pip:

    pip install django-support

then just add support to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
    	#...
        'support',
    )

Boom.
